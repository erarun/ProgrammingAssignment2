## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly 
## These functions demonstrate the way the inverse of a matrix can be cached.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
